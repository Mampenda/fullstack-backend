# Gradle & Spring Boot

Gradle is the open source build system of choice for Java, Android, and Kotlin developers.

## Installation

Follow these [steps](https://gradle.org/install/) to install Gradle or use the [sdkMAN](https://sdkman.io/) command

```bash
sdk install gradle
```
## Sign-up page
I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EQyWl5cHjc) by [Alan Lands](https://www.youtube.com/@AlanLands) to create the sign-up page.
I also used some scripts which can be found in the links added [here](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js)
and [here](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js).

I imported the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font-family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for styling.

## User login and registration
I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7pGCmVxx10) and this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/Alanlands1/springbootBackend)
as a tutorial on how to implement user login and registration.

#### Dependencies used in Spring Boot Initializer:

- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) aka Java Persistence API, to simplify database interactions using JPA

### Rest API w/ SpringBoot and Gradle | CRUD REST API

I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-cePk1ruuY&ab_channel=TechHelp) to initialize the API
and I checked that it worked with the [Postman API platform](https://www.postman.com/). I also used
this [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1oBBulPlvs84AmRmT-_3dGz4KHYuINsj) as a starting point.

#### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
- [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), to manage node.js versions
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as a database (I have two listed, so I might have to look into that later)
